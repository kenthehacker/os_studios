kenpi@kenpi:~/Desktop/studios/os_studios/studio11 $ time ./big_loop 1
processor: 1

real    0m9.355s
user    0m8.451s
sys     0m0.046s

3)
the DBUS daemon interrupted the process as well as kworker as well as sched_switch;
i know this happened because the sched_switch interrupts the big_loop which then either the kworker or the DBUS daemon 
occupied the 0th core.

4)
both sudo and non sudo runs at most 99 this is becausein the piazza post
we hard set the max limit and i chose 99

5)
it was interrupted by lightdm 
also when we compare it with the original dat file,
i noticed that this one actually had a couple times
where the CPU was in idle.
Furthermore, the block of time which the process occupied
the CPU was larger


6)
for CPU 0 there were 84 sched_switches
for CPU 1: 830
for CPU 2: 1426
for CPU 3: 2906

there were significantly less sched_switches for CPU 0

7)
the range went from 50 to 99, the things that had  priorities 
included migration and kthreads
i believe these had real time priority as the kernel
needs to have real time priority in order to migrate
certain tasks between different cores with accurate
timing
