[ken.m@linuxlab002 studio17]$ ./pipe 
Parent recieved folowing message(s)
hello, im the child 
Anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time 
Bite my shiny metal ass

3.
on one terminal i ran the following:
[ken.m@shell studio17]$ ./fifo 
Reading from fifo: 
kill all humans
[ken.m@shell studio17]$ 


on the second i ran the following:
[ken.m@shell studio17]$ echo "kill all humans" > bender

to accomplish this, i defined my path:
#define FIFO_NAME "bender"

when the following executes, it waits until it reads something
printf("Reading from fifo: \n");
while(fgets(buff,sizeof(buff),file)){
    printf("%s",buff);
}

so it's quite clear its working fine

this was the output:
Reading from fifo: 
got 1 doubled: 2
got 2 doubled: 4
got 3 doubled: 6
got 4 doubled: 8
got 5 doubled: 10
got 43 doubled: 86
got 23 doubled: 46
got 45 doubled: 90
got 43 doubled: 86
got 23 doubled: 46
got 56 doubled: 112
got 3 doubled: 6
got 54 doubled: 108
got 2 doubled: 4
got 345 doubled: 690
got 6 doubled: 12
got 543 doubled: 1086
got 23 doubled: 46
got 45 doubled: 90

these are indeed the correct inputs and outputs so i think its running correctly
