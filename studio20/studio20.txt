It just prints the number incrementing by 1 all the way to 50k, 
if i hit cntrl c then the program terminates immediately

now, whenever i do conrol c, itll interrupt but the program continues
it'll mark the called[i] = 1 so that if on the i'th iteration i hit control c,
itll mark the array so that after the loop ends, for every i'th iteration
there was an interrupt, itll print where the interrupt occurred

when i hit control c the program terminated and prints where it last left off

Caught SIGINT 
7264
i: 97265
i: 97266

there is a data corruption right here meaning there is a data race
this is because the signal handler and the main() is running concurrently
both the handler and the main() is accessing the called[] array causing this


7.
i: 101222
Caught SIGINT
i: 101223

this worked fine, this is because write() is a sig-safe function

8.
this program runs indefinitely until SIGUSR2 occurs, until then it counts how many times 
SIGUSR1 is invoked and once SIGUSR2 is invoked itll print the counter value

kenpi@kenpi:~/Desktop/studios/os_studios/studio20 $ ./receiver 
pid: 7556
SIGUSR1 received 8 times

kenpi@kenpi:~/Desktop/studios/os_studios/studio20 $ ./sender 7556 100
this pid: 7587

this means that the receiver didnt count all of the SIGUSR1's this probably means
that we're sending it too fast and the receiver isnt handling all of the signals
