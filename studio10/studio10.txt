root@kenpi:/home/kenpi# cat /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled

top command:
11340 kenpi     20   0    1884    336    276 R 100.0   0.0   4:41.85 cpu_bound_workl   
above, we see that the CPU is running at 100%

(check screenshot for HTOP output)

kenpi@kenpi:~/Desktop/studios/os_studios/studio10 $ ps -p 11340 -o psr
PSR
  1

above shows that its running on CPU #1 when i asked it to run on CPU #1
