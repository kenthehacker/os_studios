i used ntohl and htonl because i have a for loop that sends unsigned integers; though i believe
i could have used the other set as well. 

i.e. in this snippet of code:
if (argc == 2 && strcmp(argv[1], "quit") == 0) {
    payload = htonl(kill_server);
    if (write(cli_socket, &payload, sizeof(payload))<0){
        perror("CLIENT TO KILL SERVER Fail");
        exit(1);
    }
    close(cli_socket);
    return 0;
}
i'm expecting to send the unsigned int 418 so i convert the value stored in 
kill_server variable to the bytes and write that which would get converted
by ntohl 


7.
to handle short reads i check if the number of bytes, which is set from read()
i check if it is smaller than sizeof(msg)

to check for short writes i check if the size of written is the same size as the payload 
if it is then i kill the client so it can be restarted
