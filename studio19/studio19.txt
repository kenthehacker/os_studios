the difference in behaviour is the way we monitor the fd for stdin_input the original code would
check for the input on stdin over and over regardless if there were data to be read from. 
the new one with edge level trigger checks for input iff there's new data inside of the stdin 
but if we don't check if there's data to be read there's a slight chance the data wont be read
